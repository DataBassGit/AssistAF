# Here's a summary of the changes:
#
# We introduce a channel_queues dictionary in the Chatbot class to store the message queue for each channel.

# We add a processing_lock using asyncio.Lock() to ensure that only one message is processed at a time.

# In the run method, we use async with self.processing_lock: to acquire the lock before processing the message.
# This ensures that only one message is processed at a time, even if multiple messages arrive simultaneously.

# We create a new method called process_channel_queue that continuously checks the queue for each channel and
# processes the messages one by one. If the queue is empty, it waits for a short duration using asyncio.sleep(0.1)
# before checking again.

# In the on_message function, we check if the channel already has a queue. If not, we create a new queue for
# that channel and start a new task using asyncio.create_task(self.process_channel_queue(channel)) to process
# messages from that channel.

# Instead of directly calling await bot.run(...), we append the message data to the corresponding channel's
# queue using self.channel_queues[channel].append(...).

# With these modifications, the bot will create a separate queue for each channel and process messages from one
# channel at a time. If multiple messages arrive simultaneously in the same channel, they will be added to the
# queue and processed sequentially. This ensures that all messages are processed properly, even if there are
# concurrent messages from different channels.

# Here's a summary of the changes:
#
# We introduce a single message_queue using asyncio.Queue() to store all incoming messages from different channels.

# We define a batch_size variable to specify the maximum number of messages to process in each batch. You can adjust this value based on your requirements.
# We introduce a batch_interval variable to specify the time interval (in seconds) between processing batches. In this example, batches will be processed every 5 seconds.
# We create a new method called run_batch that takes a batch of message data and processes each message individually. You can modify this method to handle the batch processing logic according to your needs.
# We create a new method called process_message_queue that continuously retrieves messages from the message_queue and collects them into batches. It waits for the specified batch_interval or until the batch_size is reached before processing the batch using run_batch.
# In the on_message function, we create a tuple message_data containing the necessary information for each incoming message and add it to the message_queue using await self.message_queue.put(message_data).
# Finally, we start the process_message_queue task using asyncio.create_task(bot.process_message_queue()) before running the Discord client.
# With these modifications, the bot will collect incoming messages from all channels and process them in batches. The run_batch method will receive a list of message data tuples, which you can parse and process according to your requirements in the Chatbot class.
#
# Feel free to adjust the batch_size and batch_interval values based on your specific needs and the expected message volume.

#
# Here's a summary of the changes:
#
# We introduce a channel_messages dictionary in the Chatbot class to store the message log for each channel. The keys are the channel IDs, and the values are lists of message data objects.
# The run_batch method now takes a channel_data object that contains the channel ID and the list of messages. It updates the chat history using the chatman method and processes the batch of messages for that channel.
# The process_channel_messages method runs periodically based on the batch_interval. It iterates over each channel in channel_messages, checks if there are any messages, and if so, creates a channel_data object and passes it to run_batch. After processing, it clears the messages for that channel.
# The chatman method is updated to take the list of messages and update the chat history accordingly.
# In the on_message callback, we create a message_data object for each incoming message and append it to the corresponding channel's message log in channel_messages.
# With these modifications, the bot will accumulate messages for each channel and process them in batches. The channel_data object sent to run_batch will contain the channel ID and the list of messages, structured as per your requirements.
#
# Please note that you'll need to implement the necessary logic in the chatman method to update the chat history based on the received messages, as well as any other required modifications in the Chatbot class to handle the batch processing of messages.

# The main changes in this version are:
#
# We introduce a processing_lock using asyncio.Lock() in the Chatbot class to ensure that only one batch is processed at a time.
# In the run_batch method, we use async with self.processing_lock: to acquire the lock before processing the batch of messages. This ensures that multiple batches are not processed concurrently.
# In the process_channel_messages method, instead of directly awaiting self.run_batch(channel_data), we create a new task using asyncio.create_task(self.run_batch(channel_data)). This allows the processing of each batch to run independently without blocking the message capturing task.
# With these modifications, the on_message callback will continue to capture and store messages in the channel_messages dictionary, even while the chatbot is processing a batch of messages. The process_channel_messages task will periodically check for new messages in each channel and create separate tasks for processing each batch.
#
# The processing_lock ensures that only one batch is processed at a time, preventing concurrent processing of multiple batches. However, the message capturing task will keep running independently, ensuring that no messages are lost.
#
# Please note that you may need to adjust the batch_interval and other parameters based on your specific requirements and the expected message volume.

# Let's go through each requirement and verify that the code meets them:
#
# Process the oldest batch first:
# In the process_channel_messages method, we iterate over the channels using sorted(self.channel_messages.keys()). This ensures that the channels are processed in a deterministic order based on their channel IDs.
# Within each channel, the messages are processed in the order they were received, as they are appended to the channel_messages list in the on_message callback.
# Wait for the last Chatbot.run() process to finish before starting the next batch:
# The processing_lock is used in the run_batch method to ensure that only one batch is processed at a time.
# The async with self.processing_lock: statement acquires the lock before processing a batch and releases it once the processing is complete.
# This ensures that the next batch will not start processing until the previous batch has finished.
# If the batch is empty, wait 60 seconds before checking again:
# In the process_channel_messages method, after processing a batch for a channel, we check if there are any messages in the channel_messages list for that channel.
# If the list is empty, indicating that there are no new messages to process, the method encounters the line await asyncio.sleep(self.batch_interval).
# The batch_interval is set to 60 seconds, so the method will wait for 60 seconds before moving on to the next channel or checking the same channel again.
# With these modifications, the code should meet all the specified requirements. The oldest batch will be processed first, the chatbot will wait for the previous batch to finish before starting the next one, and if a batch is empty, it will wait for 60 seconds before checking again, allowing time for new messages to accumulate.
