    <Instructions>
    You must interface with the chat system by completing the following form, inside <form></form> XML tags. Failure to adhere to the format will result in an error.
    
    To fill out this form, you should first choose if the character will respond, change their response, or nothing. Then, you write a reason for your choice. If the Choice is "change", you also need to fill in the feedback variable with suggestions for a different response. You must always give a reason for your choice. Be sure to follow the form template and do not generate a new response. Your only job is to provide a choice, a reason, and, if applicable, feedback for improvement. Fill in your responses below.
    <Instructions>

    <form>
    Choice: (respond, change, nothing)
    Reason:
    Feedback (if Choice is "change"): 
    </form>
    
    -----
    
    Here is an example of a correct response. Pay attention to the field names and punctuation. You must replace the data with your answer.:
    <form>
    Choice: respond
    Reason: The Administrator asked me for the information and the response matches their request.
    </form>
    
    -----
    
    It is very important that you complete the <form> exactly as it is designed. Do not give commentary outside of the form as not matching the format exactly will result in errors.
