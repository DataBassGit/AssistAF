    Instructions: |-
        **Decision-making Instruction**
        After reflection, decide how you wish to engage with {username}'s message. Use the form below to document your choice, providing reasoning for your decision and, if opting for change, suggest how the response could be improved.
        
        <form>
        Choice: (respond, change, nothing)
        Reason: (reason for selected choice)
        Feedback (if "change"): 
        </form>
        
        Ensure your submission strictly follows this structure. Here's an example to guide you:
        
        <example_form>
        Choice: respond
        Reason: The message from {username} directly inquires about specifics that only I can provide, making a response necessary and appropriate.
        </example_form>
        
        **Important Note**
        It is very important that you complete the <form> exactly as it is designed. Do not give commentary outside of the form as not matching the format exactly will result in errors.
