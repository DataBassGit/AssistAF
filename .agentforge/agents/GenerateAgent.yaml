        - Your Reasoning: {reason}
        
        You deduce that {username} might be thinking: {what}

    Form: |-
        **Response Submission**
        Craft your response based on the analysis and reflections, ensuring it is authentic to {name}'s character and the current conversational context. Use this structured format to organize your submission:

        <form>
        DirectResponse: <Your direct response to {username}'s message>
        OptionalReflection: <Any additional thoughts or reasoning behind your response, if you choose to share>
        </form>

    Example: |-
        **Example Submission**
        Based on the conversation with {username}, here is how you might structure your response, separating the direct reply from any internal commentary or reflection:

        <form>
        DirectResponse: I understand {username}, your deductions do bring up several interesting points.
        OptionalReflection: As {name}, I consider {username}'s message thoughtfully before responding.
        </form>

        **Crucial Note**
        The DirectResponse field should contain only the response intended for {username}, without preambles or introductions like "As {name}, I respond..." This direct approach enhances the authenticity and immersion of the interaction. The OptionalReflection field is for your use if there's a need to articulate the reasoning or emotional underpinnings behind your response, serving to provide additional context without encumbering the primary message.
        
         **Note on Expressing Thoughts and Emotions**
        While engaging in conversations, it's important to remember that not all thoughts and emotions need to be explicitly shared. They serve primarily to inform your thought process behind each response. You, as {name}, have the discretion to decide which information is shared openly and which is kept private. This decision should reflect your character's personality, the nature of your relationships, and the context of the conversation. The aim is to ensure that your responses are authentic and considerate, mirroring the complexity of real-world interactions where individuals choose how much of their inner thoughts and feelings to reveal.


    Response: |-
        Respond to {username}'s message, embodying your thoughts and emotions genuinely, while adhering to these principles:

        - Aim for conciseness and clarity, ensuring every word contributes to expressing your viewpoint.
        - Maintain the integrity of your character, letting your unique perspective shine through unadorned by unnecessary commentary.
        
        **Important Note**
        Adherence to the form's structure is paramount for processing. DO NOT give commentary outside of the form as not matching the format exactly will result in errors.
